{ NASA APIs }
-------------

Welcome to the NASA API portal. The objective of this site is to make NASA data, including imagery, eminently accessible to application developers. This catalog focuses on broadly useful and user friendly APIs and does not hold every NASA API.

Get Started Browse APIs

Generate API Key
----------------

Authentication
--------------

**You do not need to authenticate** in order to explore the NASA data. However, if you will be intensively using the APIs to, say, support a mobile application, then you should sign up for a [NASA developer key](https://api.nasa.gov/#signUp).

### Web Service Rate Limits

Limits are placed on the number of API requests you may make using your API key. Rate limits may vary by service, but the defaults are:

*   Hourly Limit: 1,000 requests per hour

For each API key, these limits are applied across all api.nasa.gov API requests. Exceeding these limits will lead to your API key being temporarily blocked from making further requests. The block will automatically be lifted by waiting an hour. If you need higher rate limits, contact us.

### DEMO\_KEY Rate Limits

In documentation examples, the special DEMO\_KEY api key is used. This API key can be used for initially exploring APIs prior to signing up, but it has much lower rate limits, so you’re encouraged to signup for your own API key if you plan to use the API (signup is quick and easy). The rate limits for the DEMO\_KEY are:

*   Hourly Limit: 30 requests per IP address per hour
*   Daily Limit: 50 requests per IP address per day

### How Do I See My Current Usage?

Your can check your current rate limit and usage details by inspecting the `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` HTTP headers that are returned on every API response. For example, if an API has the default hourly limit of 1,000 request, after making 2 requests, you will receive this HTTP header in the response of the second request:

`X-RateLimit-Remaining: 998`

The hourly counters for your API key reset on a rolling basis.

**Example**: If you made 500 requests at 10:15AM and 500 requests at 10:25AM, your API key would become temporarily blocked. This temporary block of your API key would cease at 11:15AM, at which point you could make 500 requests. At 11:25AM, you could then make another 500 requests.

Anyone can register for an api.nasa.gov key, which can be used to access data across federal agencies.

API Key Recovery
----------------

Please [contact us](mailto:hq-open-innovation@mail.nasa.gov) for help recovering an old API key![Image 28: Info I Icon](https://api.nasa.gov/assets/img/alerts/info.svg)You may apply for multiple keys as needed.

*   APOD: Astronomy Picture of the Day
    
    APOD
    ====
    
    One of the most popular websites at NASA is the [Astronomy Picture of the Day](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html). In fact, this website is one of the [most popular websites](https://analytics.usa.gov/) across all federal agencies. It has the popular appeal of a Justin Bieber video. This endpoint structures the APOD imagery and associated metadata so that it can be repurposed for other applications. In addition, if the `concept_tags` parameter is set to `True`, then keywords derived from the image explanation are returned. These keywords could be used as auto-generated hashtags for twitter or instagram feeds; but generally help with discoverability of relevant imagery.
    
    The full documentation for this API can be found in the [APOD API Github repository](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api).
    
    **Example image:**

*   Earth: Unlock the significant public investment in earth observation data
    
    Earth
    =====
    
    Landsat imagery is provided to the public as a joint project between NASA and USGS. A recent industry [report](http://www.fgdc.gov/ngac/meetings/december-2014/ngac-landsat-economic-value-paper-2014-update.pdf) on landsat satellite imagery data estimates that total annual value to the economy of $2.19 billion, far exceeding the multi-year total cost of building, launching, and managing Landsat satellites and sensors. The value is derived from consumers _use_ of the data. The objective of this endpoint is to give you an easy to use taste of what Landsat imagery data can provide. There are more complicated APIs available if you want to build models on top of satellite imagery, apply machine-learning, or minimize clouds in your image. NASA's Earth Science Devision has a variety of Earth imagery APIs for developers, which you can find out about in the [Earthdata Developer Portal](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/collaborate/open-data-services-and-software/api). Specifically, the [GIBS](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/GIBS/GIBS+API+for+Developers) (Global Imagery Browse Services) API may be of interest. The [Google Earth Engine API](https://earthengine.google.com/) is another powerful option. This API is powered by Google Earth Engine API, and currently only supports pan-sharpened Landsat 8 imagery.

    This endpoint retrieves the Landsat 8 image for the supplied location and date. The response will include the date and URL to the image that is closest to the supplied date. The requested resource may not be available for the _exact_ date in the request. You can retrieve a JSON that contains the inputs you provided and a URL to the resulting image through the assets endpoint. The assets endpoint no longer returns a list of potential images within your date range due to a change on the Google Earth Engine API side.
    
    The cloud score was an optional calculation that returns the percentage of the queried image that is covered by clouds, but it is not available in current versions of the API. If `False` If `HTTP Request `

    Assets
    ------
    
     This endpoint retrieves the date-times and asset names for closest available imagery for a supplied location and date. The satellite passes over each point on earth roughly once every sixteen days. [This is an amazing visualization](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/LandsatBigData/) of the acquisition pattern for Landsat 8 imagery. The objective of this endpoint is primarily to support the use of the [imagery endpoint](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#imagery).

*   EONET: The Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker
    
    EONET
    =====
    
    More and more NASA imagery is being made available via web services (WMS, WMTS, etc.) and a significant percentage of it is being produced and published in near real time (NRT=within a few hours after acquisition). This ability means that NASA imagery can be used more routinely to examine current natural events as they happen.
    
    Using client applications, such as [NASA EOSDIS’ Worldview](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/), users can browse the entire globe daily and look for natural events as they occur. Storms are regularly spotted in the tropics, dust storms over deserts, forest fires in the summers. These events are occurring constantly and NASA NRT imagery can represent them all using a variety of different data parameters. However, the user’s experience is tailored, and therefore restricted, by the client application. What if there was an API that provided a curated list of natural events and provided a way to link those events to event-related NRT image layers? Enter EONET.
    
    The Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET) is a prototype web service with the goal of:
    
    providing a curated source of continuously updated natural event metadata; providing a service that links those natural events to thematically-related web service-enabled image sources (e.g., via WMS, WMTS, etc.). Please see our [API documentation](http://eonet.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/v2.1) to learn more about how to use the EONET web services.
    
    Development of EONET began in 2015 and has been supported by [NASA’s Earth Observatory](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/) and [Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) Project](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/about/esdis-project).
    
*   EPIC: Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera
    
    EPIC
    ====
    
    The EPIC API provides information on the daily imagery collected by DSCOVR's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument. Uniquely positioned at the Earth-Sun Lagrange point, EPIC provides full disc imagery of the Earth and captures unique perspectives of certain astronomical events such as lunar transits using a 2048x2048 pixel CCD (Charge Coupled Device) detector coupled to a 30-cm aperture Cassegrain telescope.
    
    Image metadata and key information are provided by the JSON API and can be requested by date and for the most recent available date. A listing of all available dates can also be retrieved via the API for more granular control.
    
    Development of the EPIC API began in 2015, and is supported by the web development team for the [Laboratory for Atmospheres](http://atmospheres.gsfc.nasa.gov/) in the Earth Sciences Division of the Goddard Space Flight Center. More information regarding the API and retrieval of the imagery for download can be found on the [EPIC website](http://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/).
    
    ### Retrievable Metadata
    
    The following information is available for every image in the collection:
    
    *   Image \[name\]
    *   Date
    *   Caption
    *   centroid\_coordinates
    *   dscovr\_j2000\_position
    *   lunar\_j2000\_position
    *   sun\_j2000\_position

    Open Science Data Repository Public API
    =======================================
    
    NASA OSDR provides a RESTful Application Programming Interface (API) to its full-text search, data file retrieval, and metadata retrieval capabilities. The API provides a choice of standard web output formats, either JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), of query results. The Data File API returns metadata on data files associated with dataset(s), including the location of these files for download via https. The Metadata API returns entire sets of metadata for input study dataset accession numbers. The Search API can be used to search dataset metadata by keywords and/or metadata. It can also be used to provide search of three other omics databases: the National Institutes of Health (NIH) / National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO); the European Bioinformatics Institute's (EBI) Proteomics Identification (PRIDE); the Argonne National Laboratory's (ANL) Metagenomics Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (MG-RAST).
    
    In addition to study datasets, NASA OSDR also hosts metadata for 7 other data types: experiments, payloads, subjects, biospecimens, missions, vehicles, and hardware. The API for these data types is listed separately and uniform throughout, to make for easy metadata exploration.

Twenty BALB/c, 12-weeks old female mice (ten controls and ten treated) were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat for 39-42 days. Twenty mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Basal controls were housed in standard vivarium cages. Spaceflight, ground controls and basal groups had blood collected, then were euthanized, had one hind limb removed, and finally whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until dissection. All mice in this data set received only the control/sham injection.",

    API Requests with Python
    ------------------------
    
    ### Basic API Request
    
    For basic API requests, the requests python library can be used. Install the library with the command:
    
     pip install requests 
    
    We can use the requests libray to make API calls to any of the endpoints above. The python code below shows the exact commands needed to read the API endpoints that return JSON. Replace API\_ENDPOINT\_HERE with any API endpoint that returns JSON, as in the example.
    
      
    import requests   
    response = requests.get("API\_ENDPOINT\_HERE").json()   
    \# Example:   
    response = requests.get("https://osdr.nasa.gov/osdr/data/osd/files/87").json()

*   Insight: Mars Weather Service API
    
    InSight: Mars Weather Service API
    =================================
    
    (Last Updated: 3/30/2021)
    
    **THIS SERVICE HAS SIGNIFICANT MISSING DATA DUE TO INSIGHT NEEDING TO MANAGE POWER USE**:Please check out the [seasonal weather report plot](https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/) for an illustration of missing data and read [this article](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8858/insight-is-meeting-the-challenge-of-winter-on-dusty-mars/?site=insight) about how dust and distance from the sun affect Insight's power situation.
    
    NASA’s InSight Mars lander takes continuous weather measurements (temperature, wind, pressure) on the surface of Mars at Elysium Planitia, a flat, smooth plain near Mars’ equator. Please note that there are sometimes problems with the sensors on Mars that result in missing data! If you see a long gap, a search result may bring up more information on whether it is a long-lasting problem. Summaries of these data are available at [https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/](https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/).
    
    This API provides per-Sol summary data for each of the last seven available Sols (Martian Days). As more data from a particular Sol are downlinked from the spacecraft (sometimes several days later), these values are recalculated, and consequently may change as more data are received on Earth. Additionally, please note that wind and other sensor data may not exist for certain date ranges. You can check out https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/ and scroll down to the 'seasonal weather report' you'll see the gaps where no data exists for some sensors.
    
    **Example image:**
    
    ![Image 33](https://api.nasa.gov/assets/img/general/insight_photo.png)
    
    This API is maintained and provided by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Cornell University. If you find bugs in this API, please use the contact form found at [https://mars.nasa.gov/feedback/](https://mars.nasa.gov/feedback/). The rate limit for this API is every hour no more than 2000 hits for each individual IP.
    
    ### Defining the Data
    
    The summary data are provided as an object in a JSON stream, a formal definition of JSON is [RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159). Appendix A contains an abridged, typical JSON stream for this API as an example.
    
    ### HTTP Request
    
    `GET https://api.nasa.gov/insight_weather/?api_key=DEMO_KEY&feedtype=json&ver=1.0`
    
    ### Query Parameters

*   Mars Rover Photos: Image data gathered by NASA's Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit rovers on Mars
    
    Mars Rover Photos
    =================
    
    This API is designed to collect image data gathered by NASA's Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit rovers on Mars and make it more easily available to other developers, educators, and citizen scientists. This API is maintained by [Chris Cerami](https://github.com/chrisccerami/mars-photo-api).
    
    Each rover has its own set of photos stored in the database, which can be queried separately. There are several possible queries that can be made against the API. Photos are organized by the sol (Martian rotation or day) on which they were taken, counting up from the rover's landing date. A photo taken on Curiosity's 1000th Martian sol exploring Mars, for example, will have a sol attribute of 1000. If instead you prefer to search by the Earth date on which a photo was taken, you can do that, too.
    
    Along with querying by date, results can also be filtered by the camera with which it was taken and responses will be limited to 25 photos per call. Queries that should return more than 25 photos will be split onto several pages, which can be accessed by adding a 'page' param to the query.
    
    Each camera has a unique function and perspective, and they are named as follows:

*   Satellite Situation Center: System to cast geocentric spacecraft location information into a framework of (empirical) geophysical regions
    
    Satellite Situation Center
    ==========================
    
    The [Satellite Situation Center Web (SSCWeb) service](https://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/REST/) has been developed and is operated jointly by the [NASA/GSFC Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF)](https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) to support a range of NASA science programs and to fulfill key international NASA responsibilities including those of NSSDC and the World Data Center-A for Rockets and Satellites. The software and associated database of SSCWeb together form a system to cast geocentric spacecraft location information into a framework of (empirical) geophysical regions and mappings of spacecraft locations along lines of the Earth's magnetic field. This capability is one key to mission science planning (both single missions and coordinated observations of multiple spacecraft with ground-based investigations) and to subsequent multi-mission data analysis. To get started with this API please [visit this page](https://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/REST/json/).

*   Vesta/Moon/Mars Trek WMTS: A Web Map Tile Service for the Vesta, Moon, and Mars Trek imagery projects
    
    Vesta/Moon/Mars Trek WMTS
    =========================
    
    Here we have the collection of APIs that power the awesome [Mars Trek](https://trek.nasa.gov/tiles/apidoc/trekAPI.html?body=mars) and [Vesta Trek](https://trek.nasa.gov/tiles/apidoc/trekAPI.html?body=vesta) NASA web-based portals for exploration and have newly added [Moon Trek](https://trek.nasa.gov/tiles/apidoc/trekAPI.html?body=moon). These APIs can be leveraged using your favorite OGC RESTFul Web Map and Tile Service (WMTS) client. Please visit [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts) for more information about WMTS. To help you get started, we've included some demos using the ESRI javascript client library for [Mars](https://api.nasa.gov/mars-wmts/catalog/) and [Vesta](https://api.nasa.gov/vesta-wmts/catalog/).
    
    This API is maintained and provided by the NASA [Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI)](http://sservi.nasa.gov/) and the [Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) Trek team](mailto:MarsTrek@jpl.nasa.gov).
    
    ### Available Moon Mosaics
    
    Here is basic information about how to request image tiles from a RESTful WMTS service. The basic URL template is as follows:
    
    `http://{WMTS endpoint}/1.0.0/{Style}/{TileMatrixSet}/{TileMatrix}/{TileRow}/{TileCol}.png`
    
    \* Some services are .png and some are .jpg. Please look at WMTS GetCapabilities ResourcesURL element to find out what extension to use. In order to fill in the variables in the template URL, you need to parse the WMTS GetCapabilities XML. GetCapabilities XML can be found for each product below. From the WMTS GetCapabilities XML, find ows:Identifier element inside Style element. This value replaces{Style}. The ows:Identifier element inside TileMatrixSet element replaces{TileMatrixSet}. Inside the TileMatrixSet element in WMTS Capabilities, there is a list of TileMatrix. This is the Zoom level. Replace{TileMatrix}with the ows:Identifier found in TileMatrix element.{TileRow}and{TileCol}are row and col index for tiles. The first zoom level for a product that covers the entire globe will have two columns and one row so that the URLs are as follows:
    
    ```
    http://moontrek.jpl.nasa.gov/trektiles/Moon/EQ/LRO_WAC_Mosaic_Global_303ppd_v02/1.0.0/default/default028mm/0/0/0.jpg   
     http://moontrek.jpl.nasa.gov/trektiles/Moon/EQ/LRO_WAC_Mosaic_Global_303ppd_v02/1.0.0/default/default028mm/0/0/1.jpg
    ```
    
    The second zoom level has four columns and two rows and so on. If the image tile is missing, that means there is no data coverage in that area. You can also use coverage Bbox to calculate the coverage before requesting image tiles.
    
    For a complete listing of the Moon's Equirectangular, North Polar and South Polar based Services, please see [https://trek.nasa.gov/tiles/apidoc/trekAPI.html?body=moon](https://trek.nasa.gov/tiles/apidoc/trekAPI.html?body=moon)
