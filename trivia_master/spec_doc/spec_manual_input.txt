I want an agent that allows the user to play a trivia quiz, where they can ask up to ten questions, and then they are scored at the end how many they got right out of ten, they should also be offered hints, but be allowed to decline them if they wish. The agent should accept close approximations to answers, for example simple spelling errors or if they are very close to the answer. All the questions and answers should come from the API service provided. The use should be allowed to choose what kind of category of trivia they would like the whole quiz to be based on based on the categories supported by the trivia api as per the documentation, for example they could say history (if that is possible) or just general knowledge which would be everything.
