please create an agent that implements these three ideas in a single agent, these functionalities should be enabled using the api documentation and code templates provided

### Idea 1: Currency List Inquiry Agent
**Functionality:** This agent allows users to retrieve a list of all available currencies.

**Endpoint:** 
- `GET /currencies`

**Example Interaction:**
- **User:** "Can you show me all the currencies available?"
- **Chatbot:** "Sure! I can fetch the list of all available currencies for you. Please hold on."
- **(The agent calls the API and retrieves the currency list)**
- **Chatbot:** "Here are the available currencies: [USD, EUR, GBP, BTC, etc.]"

### Idea 2: Currency Conversion Rate Agent
**Functionality:** This agent helps users find the conversion rate between two currencies.

**Endpoint:** 
- `GET /currencies/{currencyCode}` (where `{currencyCode}` is the base currency)

**Example Interaction:**
- **User:** "What is the conversion rate from USD to EUR?"
- **Chatbot:** "I'll find the conversion rate for you. Just a moment!"
- **(The agent calls the API using `/currencies/usd.json` and retrieves the data)**
- **Chatbot:** "The conversion rate from USD to EUR is 0.85."

### Idea 3: Historical Currency Rate Inquiry Agent
**Functionality:** This agent allows users to inquire about the historical conversion rates for a specific date.

**Endpoint:** 
- `GET /currencies/{currencyCode}` (with a date)

**Example Interaction:**
- **User:** "What was the conversion rate from EUR to GBP on March 1, 2023?"
- **Chatbot:** "Let me check the historical conversion rate for you."
- **(The agent calls the API using `/currencies/eur.json` with the date parameter `2023-03-01`)**
- **Chatbot:** "On March 1, 2023, the conversion rate from EUR to GBP was 0.88."

These agents would make it easy for users to interact with the Currency Exchange Rates API through simple conversational queries.
